AP Chemistry Notes

Unit 0.5 Kinda


Moles in chemistry(What are they?)

    Moles can often be hard to understand like it took like 30 minutes for me to grasp
    it fully cuz im dense.

    So I recommend watching the following videos:

    1. Steve Mould-An Actually Good Explanation of Moles: https://youtu.be/Z_TjGRPPR9Q
    2. Organic Chemistry Tutor-Introduction to Moles: https://youtu.be/EowJsC7phzw
    3. Professor Dave Explains-The Mole: Avogadro's Number and Stoichiometry: https://youtu.be/H3VKLRNAQuY

    A mole = 6.022 * 10^23
    6.022 * 10^23 is known as Avogadro's Number

    However, this way of thinking about is unintuitive. So I perfer thinking
    about it as a quantity, similar to a dozen.
    For example with molecules A, B, and C

    A + B -> C
    We can also say

    100 A + 100 B -> 100C
    similarly we can also say

    1 Mole A + 1 Mole B -> 1 Mole C

    However, why don't we just say something like 100 A?
    That's because when doing chemistry in real life, 100 A would be something like 0.00000000001 grams
    and we usually don't do chemistry with such small amounts like that, so we use moles.
    
    Now, what is the mass of 1 mole of a element like Lithium?

    For this we need to look at periodic table, we can see that one lithium atom is 7.0 atomic mass units(amu)
    The mole was "designed" in a way such that 1 mole would would be equal to the atomic weight
    of the that element in grams

    So, 1 mole of Lithium would be 7 grams. With this we can see that 1 mole of Iron would be 55.84 grams since
    the amu of Iron of the periodic table is 55.84


    As a result of this, we can represent amu as grams/mole (grams per mole).
    This is also known as molar mass
    EX:
        So Lithium would be 7.0 grams/mole, or have a molar mass of 7.0
    
    This can also be used to convert grams into moles.
    EX:
        7.0 grams Lithium * (1 mole/7 grams) = 1 mole
        This is basically dividing by 7


    Converting grams to moles is espically useful as in chemical equations it is done using quantities, NOT mass
    something like Carbon + Fluoride = Carbon Fluoride (btw this isn't accurate equation). It is one atom of Carbon
    and one atom of Fluoride. If we were given like 10 grams or something, it doesn't tell us anything about how many atoms we have.


Unit 1 (7%-9% of test)

Mass Percent-What percent of a molecule is each element

    Take the atomic mass of each element (Multiply by amount of atoms)
    then add them together: TOTAL MASS
    Individual Total Atomic Mass (per atom)/ Total Mass

    EX: MgCl2
    24.31 + 70.90 (get by doing 35.45x2) = 95.21 amu
    Mg = 24.31/95.21 = 25.53 %
    Cl = 70.90/95.21 = 74.47 %

Isotopes
    Are versions of elements that have the SAME # of protons and DIFFERENT # of neutrons



Mass Spectrometry-Graph of the masses of the isotopes (if they exist)
    EX: Two bars = 2 isotopes

    X-axis = Atomic Mass (Sometimes mass/charge)
    Y-Axis = Reltaive abundence

    Find the average atomic mass based on their Relative abundence
    Atomic Mass * Relative abundence of each istope(peak) THEN add them up


Electron Configuriations

Videos that are helpful:
HIGHLY RECCOMENDED Professor Dave Explains-Quantum Numbers, Atomic Orbitals, and Electron Configurations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aoi4j8es4gQ
Organic Chemistry Tutor-Electron Configuration - Basic introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwcDnFjj98

CHART FOR FILLING CONFIGURATIONS: https://www.chemistrylearner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Aufbau-Principle.jpg

EVERY configuration HAS 2 ELECRTONS


Defining values (Known as Quantum Numbers)

n: Electron's main energy level/Shell
    Higher number = more energy

ℓ = n-1
    Describes the shape of the electron orbital
    0: S orbital shape
    1: P orbital shape
    2: D orbital shape
    3: F orbital shape

m 
    Describes the number of possible configurations
    m: -ℓ to ℓ (Its L btw not 1)

    EX: D orbital's ℓ number is 2 so possible orbitals are
    -2 -1 0 1 2   TOTAL: 5 Configurations
    
    As a result the D subshell can hold a total of 10 electrons (2 per configuration)

s (This is per each electron)
    Describes the spin of each electron

    s = +1/2 OR -1/2
    Can either be -1/2 or +1/2
    In a each configuration, there are a max of two electrons (stated above), in this
    1 electron will ALWAYS be +1/2
    1 electron will ALWAYS be -1/2



Pauli Exclusion Principle

    No two electrons will be exactly same (aka have the same n, ℓ, m, and s)
    This is because even if 2 electrons are in the same configuration the spin
    will always be different (one +1/2 and one -1/2)


S - Sphere shape 
    1 POSSIBLE Configuriation
    Lowest relative energy (compared within energy level/shell)

P - Dumbell/infinity shape
    3 POSSIBLE Configuriations (one per XYZ axis)

D - Complex shape
    5 Configuriations

F - Complex shape
    7 Configuriations
    Highest relative energy (compared within energy level/shell)


NOTE:
As a result of the 3 P configurations in total it can hold 6 electrons for the subshell
since there are 2 electrons per configuration with 3 configurations

THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ALL THE OTHER SHAPES


Notation

    You write the shell frist (1, 2, 3, etc), then the subshell shape (s, p ,d, f), then you raise it
    to the number of electrons in the subshell


    EX:
        Hydrogen will be 1s^1
        1 = first Shell
        s = sphere shape
        ^1 = 1 Electron

        Helium will be 1s^2
        1 = First Shell
        s = Sphere shape
        ^2 = 2 electrons

    Beryillyum(4 electrons) will be 1s^2 2s^2
    First subshell (s) completely full
    Second shell S orbital then filled with 1 electron


    This can also be represented with brackets and noble gases[], which means that it inherits the electron configuration
    of the noble gas.
    EX:
        Beryillyum can also be: [He] 2s^2 = 1s^2 2s^2



Aufbau Principle
    The shells are filled up at each level at the lowest subshell (S configuration) until they reach
    the max for the given subshell then move onto the next shell
    aka they fill the lowest energy subshells first


    Exceptions* (kinda) 

    Khan Academy Video on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddNsfv8iaps

    However this isn't always true as it's filled a little differently.
    For example, in calcium it's
    1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2

    You would expect the next subshell after 3p^6 to be 3d^2, but its actually 4s^2. Since 4s^2 is actually the lowest energy in this case.
    See this chart for how the electrons are actually filled: https://www.chemistrylearner.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Aufbau-Principle.jpg

    You can also see an periodic table chart for how electrons on filled: 
    https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images-archive-read-only/wp-content/uploads/sites/887/2015/05/23213431/CNX_Chem_06_04_Econtable.jpg

    On it you can see that the first two groups (columns) fill up the s subshell, these are called the s block.

    You can also see that the transition metals generally fill up the d subshell

    And the elements after the transition metals fill up the p oritals.


    Another exception
    
    The d subshell is espically stable at 5 electrons and 10 electrons. So it'll take one electron from the s subshell to achieve this.
    EX:
        Chromium you would expect to be:
        [Ar] 4s^2 3d^4
        However, the d subshell wants to get to 5, so it will take an electron to get:
        [Ar] 4s^2 3d^5


EX:
    For example an atom with 3 electrons will completely fill up the first shell
    S orbital so it will move onto the 2nd shell S orbital.

    An atom with 5 electrons will fill up the 1st shell and the 2nd S orbital 
    so it move to the P orbital in the 2nd shell



PERIODIC TABLE TRENDS

More electrons = more electron shielding "protecting" the outer electrons
making them less attracted to the nucleus


Effective Nuclear Charge
    How much pull does an electron feel from the nucleus

    Formula: Effective Nuclear Charge = Z (# of protons) - S (Shielding electrons)

    Note: The shielding electrons are all the electrons that aren't in the same shell/energy level as
    the valence electron your calculating for
    Ex:
        Mg (12 protons) is 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2
        To find the effective nuclear charge for the an valence electron you do:
        12 - 10 = 2+ 
        
        This is because you don't count any electrons in the 3 shell/energy level



Atomic Radius
    Greatest at the LEFT and BOTTOM of the table
    
    Bottom: Greatest # of electron shells
    Left: Least number of Protons 
    So weakest attraction


Ionic Radius

    Cations (Positive): Tend to be Smaller
        More less electrons so Smaller

    Anions (Negative): Tend to be bigger
        More electrons so bigger

    More Protons = Greater pull between protons and electrons


First Ionization Energy
    Essentially Energy to remove the last electron from the atom

    Greatest at RIGHT and TOP of the tablbe

    Top: Fewest amount of electron shells so closer to protons

    Right: Have greater "effective nuclear charge (basically how strong the pull of the nucleus is)" more protons to attract electrons
    (btw the more electrons doesn't really matter since they're in the same shell)


2nd, 3rd, etc. Ionization energy
    
    Above we talked about the ionization energy for one electron, so what happens if you remove more?

    Generally, as you remove more electrons the ionization energy will increase.
    Within a shell, they're still similar. However, when you move to the next shell there
    will be a spike in energy needed since ytou are moving one shell closer to the nucleus.
    Ex:
        First ionization energy: 700 kj/mol
        Second ionization energy: 1020 kj/mol
        Third ionization energy: 6500 kj/mol

        Here we can predict that there are 2 electrons in the valence shell, then the energy jumped
        since we were moving to the next shell

Photoelectron Spectrometry:

    X-axis: Relative Binding Energy per electrons (Joules)
    Y-axis: Relative Number of electrons
    
    Read left to right, each peak represents an electron configuration
    Left = Closest to nucleus (Usually s subshell)
    Right = Furthest to nucleus
    Height of the peak = # of electrons

    EX:
        A peak with a height of 2 will be an S shape (cuz 2 electrons in S shape)
        A peak with a height of 6 will be an P shape (since 6 total electrons)

    
    More electrons = Higher peak

    Generally: The more protons, the greater binding energy (so more left)


Coulomb's law

    This law describes the force between two charged particles
    This applies to electrons and protons, ions in a ionic bond, lattice energy,
    electron-electron repulsion, and more.

    F = Electrostatic Force
    k = Coulombs Constant
    q1, q2 = Charges of particles
    r = distance

    F = k * ((q1 * q2)/r^2)



UNIT 2 (7%-9%)


Potential Energy in Covalent Bonds

    Article + Graph: 
    https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Introductory_Chemistry_(CK-12)/09:_Covalent_Bonding/9.04:_Energy_and_Covalent_Bond_Formation

    In a molecule held together by covalent bonds, there are attractive forces and repulsive forces
    Normally, when they are bonded the aotms are in the most stable distance/state

    If you attempt to push the atoms together, they will want to repulse eachother (very high potential energy)
    While if you push them together, they will want to come back together (higher potential energy)

    Think of it like a spring where if you push it in, it'll try to move out. While if you pull it out, it'll try to move in


    If you graph this, the lowest peak will be the bond energy.
    More bonds = lower peak

    Additionally, a bigger atomic radius will move the entire graph to the right since they're
    naturally further apart



Hund's Rule (Might be unit 1 idk)
    I recommend watching the video linked above for better pictures skip a little ahead (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aoi4j8es4gQ)

    For each subshell (s, p, d, f), the electrons will be filled singly with paralell spins up
    
    In the case of an 2p subshell, there will be 6 total spots (2 per configuration)

    __ __ __
    First, it will begin by filling one in each configuration facing up

    ↑_ ↑_ ↑_
    Like this going left to right

    Then they will pair up with new electrons facing down

    ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓
    Like this, also going left to right

    If there were only five electrons it would look like this:
    ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑_

    Unpaired electrons make the atom: PARAMAGNETIC
        This means that CAN interact with magnetic fields

    Fully paired electrons make the atom: DIAMAGNETIC
        This means that it CAN'T interact with magnetic fields


    The electrons start filling separate subshell configurations before paring up since this keeps them the
    furthest apart (negatives repulse) and the lowest energy

    

Ionic Bonds

    Ionic bonds are bonds where an electron is TAKEN from an atom
    This results in a positive and negative ion, and these will be attracted to eachother forming a bond
    (Like a magnet)
    EX:
        NaCl is Na+1Cl-1
        Where Chlorine takes one electron from Sodium, making Sodium positive ion and Chlorine a negative ion


    Lattice Energy (calculated by coulombs law)

    Essentially the energy/how strong the ionic bond is
    Factors that affect lattice energy are:

    Charge
        Increased Magnitude of charge = INCREASED lattice energy
        Think about it like a stronger magnet = harder to take apart
        EX:
            Na+1Cl-1 vs Mg+2O-2
            MgO would have a higher lattice energy since the the NaCl


    Distance
        Increased distance = LOWER lattice energy
        Magnets further apart means a lesser pull together

        Larger atomic radii of atoms = further apart
        So larger atoms bonded together will have a lower lattice energy compared to smaller
        atoms since they're further apart(assuming equal magnitude of charge)
        EX:
            Li+1F-1 VS Na+1Cl-1
            LiF would have a higher lattice energy since they're smaller and closer together,
            so the pull is stronger

    IMPORTANT: 
    
    Use charge FIRST to determine lattice energy THEN use distance
    Ex:
        If your comparing two molecules and the first one has a greater magnitude of charge
        while the 2nd molecule has a lower distance.
        
        The first molecule will have a greater lattice energy since it has a greater magnitude of charge
        despite being further apart


Relative Melting Points (Ionic)
 
    Ionic compounds that have a HIGHER lattice energy will have a HIGHER melting point
    Think about it like its harder to pull apart so its harder to melt

    So molecules with a higher magnitude of charge (or lower distance if charge is equal)
    will have a higher melting point


Covalent Bonds
    
    Covalent bonds are bonds that form by the sharing of electrons between atoms
    they typically result in the atoms atoms having full valence electron shells


Metallic Bonds

    In metallic bonds, the electrons of free-flowing (Can move around easily)
    Called "Sea of electrons"
    This is due to the electrons being loosely bound to the nucleus

    Results in properties like: Conductivity, Malleability, and strength


Electronegativity

    Essentially, how much an atom wants electrons

    Greatest at the top right (Due to small atomic radius, and proton pull)
    Also excludes noble gases (rightmost column) since they already have fill shells

    Determines the type of bond that is formed

    Greater than 1.4: Ionic Bonds
    
    Less than 1.4: Covalent bonds

        Greater than 0.5 (but less than 1.4): Polar covalent bond
        Less than 0.5: Non-polar covalent bond
    
Predicting Bonding (Generally)
    NOT ALWAYS TRUE BTW
    Metal + Metal = Metallic Bond
    Non-metal + non-metal = Covalent Bond
    Metal + non-metal = Ionic Bond


Polar Covalent Bonds result in a: Dipole

    In a dipole, electrons will spend more time at one side of a molecule,
    making that side paritally negative (δ-) and one side paritally positive (δ+)



Helpful Video for stuff below
    Organic Chemistry Tutor-Hybridization of Atomic Orbitals - Sigma & Pi Bonds - Sp Sp2 Sp3: https://youtu.be/pdJeQUd2g_4

Types of Bonds (for covalent):
    Sigma Bonds (Most stable)
    Pi Bonds

    Sigma bonds- First bond is ALWAYS a Sigma bond

    Pi bonds-ONE of the bonds in a double is a PI, TWO in a Triple Bond

    Essentially:

    Single Bond: 1 Sigma Bond  
        THE LONGEST BOND

    Double Bond: 1 Sigma, 1 Pi
        Shorter Bond

    Triple Bond: 1 Sigma, 2 Pi
        Even Shorter bond



Hybridization:
    Steric Number = # of Electrons pairs + Sigma bonds
    
    Hybridization is the combining of electron subshells

    Bonding will start with the LOWEST energy level (s) in the shell/energy level and move up

    Steric # of 2 = sp^1
        Valence Shell: First s configuration is bonded, then the P configuration

        50% s character
        50% p character

    Steric # of 3 = sp^2
        Valence Shell: First the s configuration is bonded, then the two other p configurations   

        33% s character
        66% p character

    Steric # of 4 = sp^3
        Valence Shell: First the s configuration is bonded, then the 3 p configurations

        25% s character
        75% p character        

    Steric # of 5 = sp^3d



Solids

    oh yeah I forgot, molecules can be connected through weak london dispersion forces

    Molecular Covalent

        Discrete molecules that are formed with covalent bonds
        Generally low strength aka low melting point, easy to break due to weaker partial charges
        EX: H2O
    

    Network Covalent

        Molecules (or atoms) that are all bound together continuosly by covalent bonds
        Generally rigid and inflexible 
        EX: Diamond (Carbon) or Silicon Dioxide (SiO2)


    Ionic Solids

        Forms a lattice of ions
        Ex:
            Cl- Na+ Cl-
            Na+ Cl- Na+
            Cl- Na+ Cl-

        Usually strong due to the full charges
        Dissolves in water due to its charge and conducts electricity (in water)

        Brittle due to the lattice strucutre
        If you shift any part of the lattice, it will result in the positives next to positives (and - next to -)
        this will result in repulsion and thus breaking
    

    Metallic Solids

        Defined by free flowing "sea of electrons"
        
        Conducts electricity well since electrons can move freely along
        Maleable(Doesn't snap basically)
        Not solubility 
        Also shiny due to free electrons

Alloy

    Mixture of metal and metal or non-metal that has new properties

    Substitutional Alloy

        Alloy where the other material in slots in/replaces an spot where an metal atom would usually be
        Occurs when the new material's atoms is of an similar size to the original metal

    Intersitial Alloy

        Alloy where the other material is in the slots INBETWEEN the metal atons
        Occurs when the new material's atoms is much smaller

        Often stronger, harder, and and less ductile (ability to be stretched)


Polarity

    Not only about the symmetry of a molecule
    ABOUT IF THERE's AN UNBALANCED REGION OF ELECTRONS like ubalanced lone pairs of electrons

    Unbalanced region of electrons = Polar

    You can also think about it as electronegative atoms pulling electrons towards them (like a tug of war)
    resulting in negativity near them. Then there are lone pairs of electrons which are also negative since they're electrons.

    O=C=O For the case of CO2, the electronegative oxygens are pulling electrons, but the forces
    cancel out since they're pulling in oppsite directions

        Organic CHemistry Tutor-How to Draw Lewis Dot Structures:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFZtjSeT3XE

    Drawing the Strucutre
        1. Draw the chemical symbol(Ex:H, C, N, Pb, etc) for the atom

        2. Draw the atom that can form the most bonds in the CENTER 

        3. Determine the # of valence electrons (electrons in outermost shell)
            # for common elements are:
            Oxygen: 6 valence electrons
            Carbon: 4 valence electrons
            Hydrogen: 1 valence electron
            Nitrogen: 5 valence electrons

        4. Draw dots representing valence electrons one at a time going around (drawn up, down, left, right)
        (Ex for oxygen: Draw a dot on top, right, bottom, left. THEN pair electrons up, drawing one on top and to the right)
        Also, it doesn't matter which one you pair up (it can be the top, bottom, left, or right)

        Ex: Oxygen is   .             ..
                     .. O ..  NOT   .. O ..
                        .


    Drawing Bonds
        
        OK SO THIS ACTUALLY ISN'T FULLY RECOMMENDED CUZ IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK FOR RESONANCE STRUCTURES WHILE THE OTHER WAY DOES WORK FOR EVERYTHING
        SO JUST SCROLL DOWN TO THE RESONANCE DRAWING BONDS Guide

        //1. Determine the # of bonds (Basically # of lone pairs)
        //    Each atom would typically want 8 electrons for an full shell, except hydrogen which wants 2 electrons
        //2. Pair up the lone electrons BETWEEN atoms, each of pairs these will be a bond

        //Ex:
            //Two oxygens will bond together since each one has a lone electron, this will form a total of 2 bonds
            //and each atom will have 2 lone pairs

        However, sometimes there will be more complex bonds so read below 

Resounance and Formal Charge

    Resounance Structures

        These are molecules that can't be represented using one lewis dot diagram due to having 2 (or more) configurations. 

        In reality these molecules exist in a blended state in between possible configurations
        (like instead of a double bond and single bond, it would be like a 1.5)

        To represent them them we have multiple lewis dot strucutres with "<->" between them
        OR as a signle molecule with the bond that resonates is drawn as a dashed line 
        Ex:
            Ozone (O3 is an example of this)

            O = O - O  <->  O - O = O

        DRAWING THE BONDS
            btw i do still recommend reading the "Extremely Helpful" article above for more detail

            1. Determine the total number of valence electrons avaliable

            2. Connnect all the atoms with a single bond

            3. Determine the number of valence electrons left by subtracting the number used in bonds (btw 2 electrons per bond)

            4. Begin by checking each atom to find ones that don't have a full shell (8 is full for most elements, except hydrogen which is 2)

            5. Next begin filling atoms with electrons to fill the shell (usually 8 is full, also each bond has 2 already) 
               STARTING WITH THE ATOMS ON THE OUTSIDE 

            6. Place an any extra electrons on the center atom

            7. Determine if the center atom has a full octet, if it doesn't determine the number of bonds it needs

            8. Draw a bond with one of the outer atoms to fufill the octet for the center atom
               Remove one electron pair from the outer atom that is being bonded, these two make up will make up the bond

            9. Determine if there are any other possible configurations (for step 8), if so draw them out too

            Ex:
                Ozone (O3)
                Has 6 valence electrons per atom so a total of 18 valence electrons

                Draw the atoms connected connected with single bonds
                O - O - O

                These 2 bonds will use up 4 electrons, so we have 14 valence electrons left to distribute
                We will first fill up the oxygen's on the left and right to 8
                  ..      ..
                .. O - O - O ..
                  ..      ..

                Now, we will fill up the center oxygen with any extra electrons, in this case 2
                  ..  ..  ..
                .. O - O - O ..
                  ..      ..                

                We can see that the center oxygen still needs 2 more electrons, aka it need one more bond. 
                So we will take an electron pair from one of the oxygens (either left or right) to form this bond

                  ..  ..  ..   
                .. O = O - O ..  
                          ..    

                      OR

                  ..  ..  ..
                .. O - O = O ..
                  ..         


    Formal Charge

    Charge assuming bonds are shared equally (disregarding electronegativity)
    When assessing an strucutre, you want to aim for each atom to have an formal charge closest to 0
    If there are two possible structures that an equal formal charge, then place the formal charge on the 
    most electronegative atom

    The structures with the LOWEST formal charges (cloest to 0) will contribute the MOST to the structure

    Formula for formal charge:
        Formal Charge = Valence Electrons (Before any bonding) - Bonds - dots (lone elctrons)
    
    Ex:
        H2O                                         
      .. ..     Calculation for Oxygen: 6 valence electrons - 2 bonds - 4 dots = 0
        O       Calculation for first Hydrogen: 1 - 1 - 0 = 0
       / \      Calculation for Hydrogen: 1 - 1 - 0 = 0
      H   H 

    So this would be neutral in terms of formal charge. In reality it isn't because formal charge
    doesn't take the electronegativity of oxygen into account


VSEPER THEORY (Molecular Geometry)
    
    I suggest the Khan Academy videos for these btw

    VSEPR = Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion

    This essentially states that in a molecule the bonded atoms (technically electrons) repel eachother, and the
    lone pairs of electrons are even more repulsive than those. 

    In models,
    The fully black cone shaped bond means the atom pointed TOWARDS you
    The dashed cone bond means that the atom is pointed AWAY from you


    So now it basically just memorizing all of the combinations and the shapes created so im just gonna copy and paste it here

    Heres a Chart (Scroll Down): https://chemistrytalk.org/vsepr-theory/
    There's also a chart and more info on the Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSEPR_theory

UNIT 3 (18%–22%)

Intermolecular Forces (Forces betweem molecules)

    Everything: 
        London Dispersion Forces
            
            WEAKEST type of intermolecular force

            Result of random movements in electrons that cause temporary dipoles to form
            Scales with the size of the electron cloud/atomic radius since more electrons
            means more possible electron movement. (Bigger Atomic Radius = Stronger London Dispersion Force)
    
            Ex:
                Electron moves to the left of an atom, causing the left to be negative
                and the right side to be positive (dipole)
        

    Polar: 
        Dipole-dipole Forces

            Two polar molecules interact due to their partial positive and negative charges
            With the positve and negative ends of each interacting with eachother (like a magnet)

        Hydrogen Bonds

            Type of dipole-dipole force
            STRONGEST intermolecular force

            Occurs in polar molecules where an Hydrogen is bonded to either Nitrogen, Oxygen, or Fluorine (N, O, F)
            Since these are the most electronegative elements

    Misc.
        Ion-Dipole Forces

            This is where the a dipole molecule will interact with an ion due to their opposing charges.
            Ex:
                Polar H2O breaking apart Na+Cl- ions
                since the partially negative oxygen is be atracted to the positive sodium, while the partially positive
                hydrogen will be attracted to the negative chlorine.


Boiling Points 

    Greater intermolecular forces = Higher boiling point
    
    This is because when you boil something, you can think of it as pulling the molecules
    apart from eachother. So greater intermolecular forces would mean that it would be harder to pull apart.

    Determining (Relative) Boiling Points

        First, I would determine if any of the molecules have hydrogen bonds. If they do
        they will most likely have the highest boiling point.
        Next, I would determine if there are any polar molecules (dipole-dipole forces), they would be next. 
        Then if there were any left, you would determine them based on London Dispersion Forces
        (Greater atomic radius = Greater intermolecular forces).


Vapor Presssure
    
    So for a molecule (liquid obv), some of the highest energy molecules will evaporate.
    (Like water evaporates even if it isn't at its boiling point)

    These molecules in the air will result in a vapor pressure

    Lower Intermolecular Forces = Higher Vapor pressure

    Lower intermolecular forces means that more molecules can escape into the air
    and this will result in a greater vapor pressure


Phases of Matter (bro idk what khan academy is doing, but like they like didn't really cover this lol)

    Plasma (Not really important)
        Ionized gas
    
    Solids

        Tightly packed and held in fixed positions by intermolecular forces
        Definite shape and volume

        Crystalline solids

            Solids that have a definite organized crystal lattice strucutre
            Ex:
                Diamonds or salt (NaCl)


        Amorphous Solids

            These are solids that lack definite organized structure.
            They also don't have a definite melting point, just decreasing is viscosity 
            Ex:
                Rubber and Glass (not crystal cuz cools fast = unorganized)

    Liquid

        Definite Volume; NO definite shape

    Gas

        NO definite volume nor shape


Changing States of Matter

     To change our state (phase idk man) of matter we will either need to change either
     TEMPERATURE or PRESSURE. 

     Changing states of matter requires affecting the intermolecular bonds, when you increase temperature
     you are increasing the kinetic energy of the molecules; this allows the molecules to break the intermolecular forces
     and either melt or vaporize.

     Pressure will also affect the state of matter since you can think of pressure as pushing the molecules together.
     As a result, they will be more likely sold or liquid, since they're being pushed into eachother so much. On the otherhand,
     if you decrease the pressure the molecules are more free to move. This results in a lower boiling point (and melting) as they can
     evaporate easier with the pressure.

     Terms (you probably know these)

        Takes Energy
            -Melting: Solid -> Liquid 
            -Evaporation: Liquid -> Gas
        
        Releases Energy
            -Condensation: Gas -> Liquid
            -Feezing: Liquid -> Solid

        idk if you need these
            -Sublimation: Solid -> Gas  (Ex: Dry Ice)
            -Deposition: Gas -> Solid
        

Specific heat

    Is the amount of energy to increase 1 gram of a material by 1° Kelvin (Could also be celcius but u just convert so same)
    Given in: Joules / (grams * kelvin)

Change in Temperature

    To find how much energy (usually Joules) to increase the heat of a material. You can use the equation:

    q(Joules/Heat) =  m (mass) * C (Specific Heat) * ΔT (Change in Temperature)
    q = m * C * ΔT
    Basically how much joules to increase a certain mass of a material by a given temperature. At the end,
    the grams and kelvin cancel out, leaving you with joules


Phase Change Diagram

    Example Diagram: https://general.chemistrysteps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Phase-change-diagram-increasing-temperature.png
    Heres the entire article btw: https://general.chemistrysteps.com/heat-and-phase-change-diagrams/

    Left (Y-axis): Temperature
    Bottom (X-axis): Energy Added

    As you would expect, when you add energy to something, the temperature will increase.
    However, when the it's undergoing a phase change the temperature doesn't change (It plataeus)
    This is because the energy is going into breaking the intermolecules forces and not
    increasing the temperature


Phase Diagram

    Example Chart on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram#/media/File:Phase_diagram_of_water_simplified.svg

    X-axis (Bottom): Temperature
    Y-axis (Left): Pressure

    Shows the phase of material at varying temperature and pressures. Has three distinct regions
    one solid, one liquid, and one gas.


Ideal Gas Law

    Khan academy: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-chemistry-beta/x2eef969c74e0d802:intermolecular-forces-and-properties/x2eef969c74e0d802:ideal-gas-law/v/ideal-gas-equation-pv-nrt

    Assumptions (cuz its ideal):

        -Molecules don't interact
        -Molecules don't take up any volume 
        -Elastic (Energy Retained)


    PV = nRT
        Presssure * Volume = # of Moles * Universal Gas Constant * Temperature
    btw constant is given

    You can then use this equation to solve for variables using the given information
    For example, Pressure = (# of Moles * Constant * Temperature) / Volume
    or you can solve for moles: n = (PV)/(RT)


Partial Pressure (Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures)

    Khan Academy: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-chemistry-beta/x2eef969c74e0d802:intermolecular-forces-and-properties/x2eef969c74e0d802:ideal-gas-law/v/introduction-to-partial-pressure

    When there are multiple gases in a container, each of them will contribute to the total pressure.

    Total Pressure = Pressure1 + Pressure2 + ...
    OR

    (Total Moles * R * T) / V = (# of moles for gas1 * R * T) / V  +  (# Moles2 * R * T) / V + ...

    Since they're all in the same environment you can just cancel out the R, T, and V to just get:
    Total Moles = Moles1 + Moles2 + ...

    As a result, the partial pressure exerted molecule is proportional to the the # of molecules

    Partial Pressure / Total Pressure  =  # of moles for gas / Total # of moles


Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT)

    Assumptions (same as above btw):
        -Molecules don't interact with eachother
        -Molecules don't take up any volume/negligible 
        -Elastic (Energy Retained)

    Explaination for gases using kinetics (its in the name) to explain gases and the ideal gas law.
    Regarding: Pressure, Volume, Temperature, # of Moles

    It asserts that pressure is caused by gas molecules hitting against the walls of the container.

    "∝" means proportional btw
    These are pretty intuitive 

    PV = nRT

    BTW YOU CAN JUST LOOK AT PV = nRT for these
    like you can see if everything else is constant and you increase Volume (V)
    the temperature (T) will also increase. This can be repeated for the rest of the laws

    Volume and Pressure(Boyle's Law)

        If the volume of a container increases, then the pressure will decrease. This is because
        the gas particles will hit the walls the container less. So, Pressure is inversely proportional
        to the volume:

        P ∝ 1/V
    
    Temperature and Pressure(Guy-Lussac's Law)

        If the temperature increases, then the pressure will increase. The gas molecules will have more
        kinetic energy. As a result, they will hit the sides of the container more and with more force.

        P ∝ T 
    
    Volume and Temperature (Charle's Law)

        If the Volume increases, then to equalize, the temperature will also increase. 
        This is because if the volume increases the pressure will decrease, so to keep the pressure
        the same, the temperature will increase to compensate.
        
        V ∝ T
    
    Volume and Moles (Avogadro's Law)

        If the Volume increases, then the amount of Moles will increase to compensate and keep the same pressure.

        V ∝ n


Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

    Picture: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution#/media/File:Maxwell-Boltzmann_distribution_pdf.svg

    X-axis = speed
    Y-Axis = # of Molecules

    Distribution of the number of the molecules over their speed.

    Higher temperature = More kinetic energy

    High temperature molecules will have a distribution closer to the right and it'll be more flat.

    Low temperature molecules will have a distribution towards the left and will be more shape
    (lots of molecules clumped at low speed)


Real Gases vs Ideal Gases

    Best Real Conditions (Results ≈ Expected) = High Temperature, High Volume
    Least Ideal = Low Temperature, Low Volume

    Higher temperatures would mean that the intermolecular forces that pull the
    molecules together would be weaker

    Higher volumes would mean that the volume the molecules themselves take
    up would be negligible

    Lower Than Ideal

        Lower than ideal pressure means that there are stronger intermolecular
        forces than the ideal. This leads to less molecules hitter the walls
        and reducer the pressure even more.

    Higher Than Ideal

        Higher than ideal pressure means that the molecules are taking up more space
        than ideal. This would cause them to hit the walls more since its more crampted,
        increasing the pressure.


Mixtures

    Heterogenous/Solutions
        Non-uniform Mixtures

    Homogenous Mixtures/Solutions

        Uniform Mixtures
        Can be Solid, Liquid, Or Gas
        Ex:
            Salt water, Alloys


Molarity

    Concentration of Moles per Liter of Solutions

    M = Molarity
    
    M = # of Moles / Liter

    You can then use this to find the amount of moles in a liter, or amount of grams dissolved, etc.
    By calculating number of moles then converting to grams, etc.
        
Molality
    Not to be confused with Molarity

    Molality = Moles / Kilogram


Distillation 

    Distillation is the act of separating components through taking advantage of different
    boiling points. Typically, a liquid is heated such that only only component evaporates, it will
    then be collected then condensed, separating the two components. 
    You can also do multiple cycles to further distill it.

    Distillation Curves

        As you increase the temperature, you will typically begin seeing the first substance begin 
        to boil. This will cause the temperature to plateu (cuz energy goes into breaking intermolecular
        bonds and not increasing temp). Then, you will see the temperature begin to increase again once
        all of the first co,ponent is boiled off. Then this will repeat for the other components.


Thin-Layer Chromtography 

    This separate components taking advantage of their polarity. First, a solution placed onto a polar
    sheet of silica gel. Then, you place a less polar fluid at the bottom. This fluid will begin to move up
    the silica gel through capillary action, pulling the solution along with it.

    Components with high polarity will move less becuase it will interact and "stick" more to the silica gel.
    Components will a lower polarity will move more since it will "stick" less than the polar components.

    This can be measured with something called: Retention Factor
        Its basicallly just:

        Distance Travel by Component / Distance travled by fluid


Solubility

    Based on Khan Academy & AP Chemistry overview/study sheet linked at very top

    Solute - Thing that is being dissolved
    Solevent - The thing the solute is dissolved in

    All you need to remember is: "Like dissolves Like"

    Polar molecules will dissolve Polar molecules
        More polar = More easily dissolved
    
    Non-polar molecules will dissolve non Polar Molecules
        More non-polar = More easily dissolved
    
    Saturation

        When an solution is saturated with solute, it will become more difficult 
        to dissolve more solute. Until no more solute can be dissolved

    Temperature

        Temperature can also affect solubility depending weather the solvation reaction is
        endothermic (takes in energy/heat) or exothermic (releases energy/heat)

        Endothermic

            Increasing the temperature in a endothermic solvation reaction will provide
            more heat/energy for the reaction, increasing solubility

        Endothermic

            Increasing the temperature in a endothermic solvation reaction will provide
            more heat/energy for the reaction, increasing solubility


Spectroscopy

    Electromagnetic Spectrum Image: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum#/media/File:EM_Spectrum_Properties_edit.svg

    Electromagnetic Waves lie on a spectrum. 

    Longer Wavelengths (Low Energy) will have LESS energy compared to Shorter Wavelengths (High Energy)
    Longer Wavelengths also have a lower frequency while Shorter Wavelengths will have a high frequency


    Exciting Electrons

        When an photon "hits" an electron, if it has enough energy it will bump the electron 
        to a higher energy level. (Depending on amount of energy it can be bumped multiple shells)

        Higher Energy In = Higher Energy Out
    

Calculating Energy of a Photon

    It can be calculated using the equations:

        E = Energy
        h = Planck Constant (6.626 * 10^-34)
        f = Frequency
        c = Speed of Light (2.998 * 10^8)
        λ = Wavelength

        E = h * f
        c = λ * f

        Energy = Planck Constant * Frequency
        Speed of light = Wavelength * Frequency
        

        Since everything except the wavelength is a constant, you only need to know the wavelength
        to find the energy. To find frequency given the wavelegnth, you can rearrange the second equation
        to Frequency = Speed of Light / Wavelength AKA (f = c / λ). Now you can plug that into the first equation.
        To make it simplier you can just make it:

        E = (h * c) / λ

        Ex:
            You are given a wavelength of 500 nm 

            Using the arranged equation: E = (h * c) / λ

            E = ((6.626 * 10^-34) * (2.998 * 10^8)) / 5 * 10^2   ≈   3.973 * 10^-24 Joules

Photoelectric Effect

    If the energy of the photon is high enoguh (something like ultraviolet light), it can cause 
    an electron to fully break away and be released. The energy required is the ionization energy
    (yeah remember that) and the rest of the energy goes into the speed.





Spectrophotometry (Concentration of Molecules and the absorbanence at each concentration)

    Obviously, when light passes through an liquid some light will be loss since it'll be absorbed,
    while the rest is transmitted.

    The GREATER the concentration of solute, the GREATER the absorbance of light
    The GREATER the path length (amount light travels), the GREATER the absorbance of light.

    The rest of the light is transmitted, it can be measured using:

        Transmittance is
            Light Out / Light In

    Absorbance is

        -log10(Transmittance) OR -log10(Light Out / Light In)
    

    With this data, you can graph transmittance along with concentration
    With these several known concentrations and their coressponding absorbanences, you can plot these
    Next, draw the line of best fit for the points
    Now you can determine absorbance of unknown concentrations :D (im going insane)


    Concentration/Path length relationship with Absorbance is LINEAR
    

Beer-Lambert Law (ngl bro the wikipedia for this page looks scary)

    Article: https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Spectroscopy/Electronic_Spectroscopy/Electronic_Spectroscopy_Basics/The_Beer-Lambert_Law

    Determines the absorbance given path length and concentration, and a constant (different for each substance)

    A = Absorbance
    ε = Molar Absorptivity (Constant for each substance)
    l = path length of light
    c = concentration

    A = ε * l * C

    Absorbance = Molar Absorptivity * Light Path Length * Concentration

    
    And as with all equations, you can rearrange this to figure out missing values

Polyatomic Ions (Just some info to know)
    
    Organic Chemistry Tutor-How to Memorize The Polyatomic Ions - Formulas, Charges, Naming: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXBEh7nd9KQ
    we're probably gonna be forced to memorize so lollll

    Polyatomic ions are ions that contain multiple atoms
    (Its in the name)
    They (The polyatomic ion only, not the entire ionic molecule) are held together be covalent bonds.
    Examples:
        Hydroxide: OH-
        Sulfate: SO₄²⁻
        Nitrate: NO₃⁻
        Phosphate: PO₄³⁻
    
    Something like:

        Na₃PO₄
        This is composed of 3 sodiums, and 1 phosphate (The phosphate contains one phosphorus and 4 oxygens)

        So, it will break apart into: 3 sodium ions (3 Na⁺) and 1 phosphate (PO₄³⁻)


Ionic Equations

    GENERAL RULES 

        The masses must be balanced on both sides (Aka u can't put 3 carbon in and get 5 out)
        The charges must also be balanced on both sides

    Molecular Ionic Equations

        These are the standard equations with the neutral ions.
        Ex:
            NaCl(aq) + AgNO3(aq) -> NaNO3(aq) + AgCl(s)

    Complete Ionic Equations

        These are the equations where it shows the ions are split from eachother by the water
        (btw the things labeled as solid don't dissolve)
        Ex:
            Na+(aq) + Cl-(aq) + Ag+(aq) + NO3-(aq)  -->  Na+(aq) + NO3-(aq) + AgCl(s)
    
    Net Ionic Equations

        These are equations where the spectator ions are removed (Ions on both sides of equations)
        Only molecules participating in the reaction are left 

        Ex:
            The equation from above will turn into

            Cl-(aq) + Ag+(aq)--> AgCl(s)

            As you can see the Na+ and the NO3- are removed from both sides
        
        
Physical V.S Chemical Reactions

    Chemical Changes 

        Involves changing the compounds themselves through the breaking/making (Change composition)
        of bonds, resulting in new substances

    Physical Chanes

        Changes in the state of the chemicals, no bonds are broken or made (No change compositon)


Balancing Equations

    Balancing equations is ensuring that you have an equal amount of each atom going in and out.
    If you don't, you may multiply molecule so that it matches up.

    EX:
        Na + O2 -> Na2O
        To balance oxygen we will mutiply right side by 2

        Na + O2 -> 2 Na2O
        To balance sodium will we multiply sodium by 4

        4 Na + O2 -> 2 Na2O
        Final equation

    EX:
        C3H8 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O
        To balance C multiply by 3. To balance H multiply by 4

        C3H8 + O2 -> 3 CO2 + 4 H2O
        To balance oxygen multiply O2 by 5

        C3H8 + 5 O2 -> 3 CO2 + 4 H2O
        Final equation


Stoichiometry

    This is basically finding out and balancing the equation

    Steps:

        1. Ensure that you have an balanced equation, if you don't balance it


        2. Convert your given units to moles (All work should also be done in moles)
            Reminder:
                To convert grams to moles, find the molar mass of the molecule (grams/mole).
                Then you can divide it by the grams.
                Example: 
                H2O would have a molar mass of 18.015 grams/mole
                since it is composed of 2 hydrogens (1.008 grams each) and 1 oxygen (15.999 grams)
                when you add these up you get 18.015 grams/mole (OR 1 mole/18.015)

                If you have 50 grams you divide by 18.015 grams to get 2.775 moles of H2O
        

        3. Find the amount of moles for the other molecules using the mole ratio

            The mole ratio will be in the balanced equation. 
            For example, 4 CH4 + 3 H2O -> whatever product

            The mole ratio between H2O and CH4 will be:
            3 moles H2O / 4 moles CH4
            (This basically says for every 4 moles of CH4, there will be 3 moles of H2O)

            Reciprical:
            4 Moles CH4 / 3 Moles H2O
            (This basically says for every 3 moles of H2O, there will be 4 moles of CH4)

            So if you have 2.775 moles of H2O, to find the number of moles of CH4 you would do 
            2.775 Moles H2O * (4 Moles CH4 / 3 Moles H2O) = 3.7 moles of CH4

            You can see that the units of Moles H2O will be cancled out, leaving you with CH4


        4. Convert back to grams

            You can then convert back to grams using the molar mass. 
            For example, 3.7 moles of CH4 would be 3.7 moles * (16.043 grams / mole) = 59.36 grams


Limiting Reactants

    Organic Chemistry Tutor-Stoichiometry - Limiting & Excess Reactant, Theoretical & Percent Yield: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK2yK_JTUH4

    In some situations, you don't always have the exact amount of molecules to cleanly complete the reaction.
    Sometimes, you might have too much of one reactant or too little of another.

    Limiting Reactant = Reactant fully consumed (Too little compared to other reactant)

    Excess Reactant = Reactant not fully consumed (Too much compared to other reactant)

    Finding the Limiting Reactant

        Method 1: Dividing Moles by Coefficent

            If you have the moles for each reactant, you can divide the moles by the coefficent in the equation.
            The lower quotient will be the limiting reactant while the higher quotient will be the excess reactant.

            This is because what your doing is basically calculating how many times an reaction can occur. 
            With the example: 4 CH4 + 3 H2O

            If you have 8 moles of CH4, 8/4 = 2, means the reaction can be done 2 times fully.
            If you have 7 moles of H2O, 7/3 = 2 1/3; this means the reaction can be done 2 1/3 times fully.

            So, in this case the CH4 will be limiting reactant, since it can only be completed 2 times fully with the amount
            that we have. While the H2O is the excess reactant, since it can occur 2 1/3 times fully with the amount we have
        
        
         Method 2: Using Mole Ratios 

            Essentially, we are going to find how much of the other reactant is needed for our given amount.
            Using 4 CH4 + 3 H2O:

                The mole ratio between these is 3 moles H2O / 4 moles CH4

                In the case we have 7 moles H2O and 8 moles CH4, so we can do 8 Moles CH4 * (3 moles H2O / 4 moles CH4) = 6 moles H2O needed
                (Make sure the units of the molecules cancel out so that you get the desired result)

                In, this case, we have more than enough H2O, so it shall be the excess reactant.
                So, CH4 will be the limting reactant
        

        Method 3: Theoretical Yield

            Here, you will compare the theoretical amount of yield for each amount of reactant
            Then, the reactant the results in the LOWER theoretical yield will be the limting reactant
            Using 2 Al + 3 Cl2 -> 2 AlCl3:

            Lets say we have 5 moles of Al and 6 moles of Cl2.

            Theoretical Yield for 5 moles Al:

                We can see that for every 2 moles of Al we will have 2 moles of product. Basically 1 : 1
                The ratio can be: 2 moles AlCl3 / 2 moles Al

                5 moles Al * (2 moles AlCl3 / 2 moles Al) = 5 moles AlCl3

            Theoretical Yield for 6 moles Cl2

                We can see for every 3 moles of Cl2 we can 2 moles of product
                The ratio will be: 2 moles AlCl3 / 3 moles Cl2

                6 moles Cl2 * (2 moles AlCl3 / 3 moles Cl2) = 4 moles AlCl3

            
            We can see that 6 moles Cl2 will result in LESS product, so it is the limiting reactant.
            While the 5 moles of Al will be the excess reactant


Percent Yield

    Percent Yield = (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) * 100

    Multiplied by 100 to convert to percent

        
Reduction-Oxidation (Redox) Reactions
    
    Redox Reactions are reaction where electrons are transferred
    
    Professor Dave Explains Video-Oxidation-Reduction Reactions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXvtkwubQQg

    Reduction = Gaining of electrons 
    Oxidation = Losing of electrons 

    
    Oxidation Numbers

        These are hypothetical charge values for each atom (as if it was in a ionic bond)
        These are notated with the negative/positive in front of the number

        Some Guidelines

        1. Elements always have a charge of 0 (H, O2, Ag, Cl, 4Fe, etc)

        2. Monoatomic ions have a oxidation number the same as its charge (Fe^2+ is +2)

        3. In neutral molecules, oxidation numbers add up to 0 (CO2, 4 - 4 = 0)

        4. Oxygen usually has a oxidation number of -2

        5. In polyatomic ions, the oxidation numbers must add up to the charge (NO₃⁻, 5 + (-2 * 3) = -1)

        6. Hydrogen is almost always +1


    Identifing Redox Reactions

        You can list the oxidation states of each molecule involved in the reaction. If they
        change (before vs after reaction), then it's a redox reaction. This is because it involved a change 
        in electrons

        These are the basic steps:
          
            1. Write the half reactions.
            2. Balance the atoms other than O and H.
            3. Balance the oxygens by adding H2O.
            4. Balance the hydrogens by adding H+.
            5. Balance the charges by adding electrons.
            6. Make the number of electrons equal, and add the half reactions.
            7. Neutralize the H+ by adding OH-, creating H2O  (DO THIS STEP ONLY IF ITS A BASIC SOLUTION)

KINETICS and RATE Laws
PROFESSOR DAVE EXPLAINS VIDEO ON KINETICS IS VERY HELPFUL FOR THIS SO WATCH THAT
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYqQCojggyM


To find the order of reaction of a molecule you need to find a trial were only that
reactant changes. Then you can look at the initial rate of reaction (reaction rate
 at that given moment) to compare them.

Initial Rate of Reactions should be in Moles/second


0th Order reactions  [A]^0
No effect


1st order reactions :)  [A]^1

The initial rate of reaction depends on the concentration linearly of one reactant
Ex: Doubling of the reactant A2 results in reaction rate doubling from 1 to 2


2nd order reaction  [A]^2

The initial rate of reaction depends on the concenetration an reactant squared.
Ex:
    You double the amount of reactant D2 this results in 2^2 increase in imitial reaction
    rate. Aka a quadrupling of the initial reaction rate. 
    If you triple the reactant amount, it would result in a 3^2 increase in initial reaction
    rate.


ALSO overall reaction order is the sum of the orders of the reactants


HOW TO WRITE THE RATE Laws

    Rate would be equal to k (rate constant) times the first reactant power of the reaction order 
    times the next reactant to the power of the reaction order and so on.

    Rate = k * [Reactant1 Moles]^order * [Reactamt2 Moles]^order and so on


    With a reactants A and B in moles, first order and second order respectively. It would be
    (btw just take values from any trial)

    Rate = k * [A Moles]^1 * [B Moles]^2



HOW TO FIND k (reaction constant)

    Ignoring the everything else but the moles, using that you get Moles to some power (M^3)
    Now you must convert those units into Moles/Seconds.

    Using our example above:

    Rate = k * [A Moles]^1 * [B Moles]^2
    Focusing on only the moles you get

    Moles^3
    now we need to get to Moles/Second by diving by Moles^2 * Seconds

    Moles^3/(Moles^2 * Seconds) = Moles/Seconds

    So here you get 1/Moles^2 * Seconds 
    also represented as Moles^-2 * seconds^-1

    Now you can just solve the for the value by dividing Rate/(A * B^2) for this case 
    So k = Rate/(A*B^2) * Moles^-2 * Seconds^-1 
    (except A and B would be actual values)


Identifying Order using Graphs

    0th Order
    k[A]^0 

    Graph:
    X-axis: Time
    Y-axis: [A]
    Linear decrease (y=-x)


    1st Order
    k[A]^1

    Graph:
    X-axis: Time 
    Y-axis: ln[A]
    Linear decrease (y=-x)


    2nd Order
    k[A]^2
    
    Graph:
    X-axis: Time 
    Y-axis: 1/[A]
    Linear Increase (y=x)

    By plotting [A], ln[A], 1/[A] you can identify which one gives you a straight line
    and that would be the reaction order 

    The rate constant would be equal to the slope of the straight line graphically


Reaction Mechanisms

    Reaction Intermediates

    Molecules that are produced in a early step and then used in a later step
    EX:
        BF3 + O2 -> BF2 + O2F
        BF2 + O2 -> O2F2 + B

        Here you can see that BF2 is an intermdeiate since it is used up and then
        is consumed later

        You can also add them up to get the overall balanced equation of:


        BF3 + BF2 + 2 O2 -> BF2 + O2F + O2F2 + B
        Then you can see that the intermediate BF2 is on both sides so you can just 
        remove it, getting

        BF3 + 2 O2 -> O2F + O2F2 + B


    Rate Determining Step

        This will be the slowest process/step in the reaction, acting as a bottleneck
        The rate equation is usually determined from this step.
        Usually determined by looking at rate laws.

        A lot of the time it would be the first step
    
    The Rate law for the overall reaction is the rate law of the slowest step
