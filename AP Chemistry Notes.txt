AP Chemistry Notes

Unit 1:



Mass Percent-What percent of a molecule is each element

    Take the atomic mass of each element (Multiply by amount of atoms)
    then add them together: TOTAL MASS
    Individual Total Atomic Mass (per atom)/ Total Mass

    EX: MgCl2
    24.31 + 70.90(35.45x2) = 95.21 amu
    Mg = 24.31/95.21 = 25.53 %
    Cl = 70.90/95.21 = 74.47 %

Mass Spectrometry-Graph of the masses of the isotopes (if they exist)
    EX: Two bars = 2 isotopes
    Find the average atomic mass based on their Relative abundence
    Atomic Mass * Relative abundence: THEN add them up

 Crash course, professor dave explains=GOAT go watch separate video about them

EVERY configuration HAS 2 ELECRTONS

n-number: Electron's main energy level/Shell

l = n-1
    Describes the shape of the electron orbital
    0: S orbital
    1: P orbital
    2: D orbital
    3: F orbital

The shells are filled up at each level starting at S until they reach
the max configurations for the given shell then move onto the nect shell

For example an atom with 3 electrons will completely fill up the first shell
S orbital so it will move onto the 2nd shell S orbital.

An atom with 5 electrons will fill up the 1st shell and the 2nd S orbital 
so it move to the P orbital in the 2nd shell

Possible Configurations: -l to l
EX: D orbital is l number is 2 so possible orbitals are
-2 -1 0 1 2   TOTAL: 5 Configurations


S - Sphere shape 
    1 POSSIBLE Configuriations

P - Dumbell/infinity shape
    3 POSSIBLE Configuriations ROTATED ALONG XYZ AXIS

D - Complex shape
    5 Configuriations

F - Complex shape
    7 Configuriations

As a result the all of the P shapes can hold 6 electrons per shell
since there are 2 electrons per configuration with 3 configurations
THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ALL THE OTHER SHAPES


EX:
Hydrogen will be 1s^1
1 = first Shell
s = sphere shape
^1 = 1 Electron

Helium will be 1s^2
1 = First Shell
s = Sphere shape
^2 = 2 electrons

Beryillyum(3 electrons) will be 1s^2 2s^1
First shell S orbital mpletely full
Second shell S orbital then filled with 1 electron

If there were more it will finish filling the S electron orbital then begin
filling up the next P orbital.




Atomic Radius
    Greatest at the LEFT and BOTTOM of the table
    
    Bottom: Greatest # of electron shells
    Left: Least number of Protons 
    So weak attraction


Ionic Radius

    Cations (Positive): Tend to be Smaller
        More less electrons so Smaller

    Anions (Negative): Tend to be bigger
        More electrons so bigger

    More Protons = Greater pull between protons and electrons


First Ionization Energy

    Essentially Energy to remove the last electron from the atom
    Greatest at RIGHT and TOP of the tablbe

    Top: Fewest amount of electron shells so closer to protons
    Right: Have greater "effective nuclear charge;" more protons to attract electrons


Photoelectron Spectrometry:

    X-axis: Relative Binding Energy per electrons (Joules)
    Y-axis: Relative Number of electrons
    
    Read left to right, each peak represents an electron configuration
    Height of the peak = # of electrons 
    Ex: More electrons = Higher peak

    Generally: The more protons, the greater binding energy (so more left)



UNIT 2

Lewis dot electron diagrams

Draw pairs of the valence electrons around each atom
Replace the shared electrons/bonds with a line


Types of Bonds:
    Sigma Bonds
    Pi Bonds

    Sigma bonds-Every Single Bond and ONE of the bonds in a double bond is
     a Sigma bond

    Pi bonds-ONE of the bonds in a double is a PI, TWO in a Triple Bond

    Single Bond: Sigma Bond
    Double Bond: 1 Sigma, 1 Pi
    Triple Bond: 1 Sigma, 2 Pi

Hybridization:
    Number of Electron domains = Electrons pairs and bonds

    4 Electron domains = sp^3
        Valence Shell: First the s configuration is bonded, then the p configurations

    3 Electron Domains = sp^2
        Valence Shell: First the s configuration is bonded, then the two other p configurations

    2 Electron Domains = sp^1
        Valence Shell: First s configuration is bonded, then the P configuration

Molecular Geometry & Bond angles
    
    2 Bonds/Bent: 104.5 degrees

    3 Bonds (with 0 lone pairs)/Trigonal Planar: 120 degrees

    Multiple Central Atoms= Multiple Molecular Geometries
    Ex: Tetrahedral(4 bonds):109.5, Trigonal Planar: 120, Bent: 104.5


Polarity

    NOT ABOUT THE SYMMETRY OF THE MOLECULE
    ABOUT IF THERE's AN UNBALANCED REGION OF ELECTRONS

    Bent Structure = Polar
    Unbalanced region of electrons = Polar


Intermolecular Forces

    Polar: Dipole-dipole Forces
        Kinda also includes Hydrogen Bonding

    Everything: London Dispersion Forces


Melting Points
    THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF charge

    Greater Magnitude of charge = Higher Melting Points
        ex: Na+Cl- and Na2+2S-2
        Na2S would have a higher melting Points
    
    Smaller Molecules = Higher Melting Points


Ionic Compounds form a 3 Dimensional Lattice

In water, the H(parital +) and O(partial -) will pull apart the ions



UNIT 3

Gas Laws
PV = nRT
Presssure * Volume = # of Moles * Universal Gas Constant * Temperature

Converting Grams and Molar Mass
Molar Mass is grams/mole (grams per mole)


Spectrophotometry (Concentration of Molecules and the absorbanence at each concentration)

    Run a Blank (aka 0 concentration and 0 absorbanence)
    Then have several known concentrations and their coressponding absorbanences
    Next, draw the line of best fit 
    Now you can determine absorbance of unknown concentrations :D 



Net Ionic Equations

IMPORTANT: Metal ions react WITH metal ions; non-metals react WITH non-metal ions

There can be spectator ions these are NOT A PART OF THE EQUATION

You need to balancce the amounts of each atom of the products and the reactants

EX:
    Mg, Cu2+ and Cl-
    Cl- is an spectator ion since its an non metal

    Mg -> Mg2+ + 2e-  Oxidation- Losing Electrons
    2e- + Cu2+ -> Cu  Reduction- Gaining Electrons
    
    Mg(s) + Cu2+(aq) -> Mg2+(aq) + Cu(s)


Burning: Includes adding OXYGEN to an equation

EX:
    Na + O2 -> Na2O
    To balance oxygen we will mutiply right side by 2

    Na + O2 -> 2 Na2O
    To balance sodium will we multiply sodium by 4

    4 Na + O2 -> 2 Na2O
    Final equation

EX:
    C3H8 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O
    To balance C multiply by 3. To balance H multiply by 4

    C3H8 + O2 -> 3 CO2 + 4 H2O
    To balance oxygen multiply O2 by 5

    C3H8 + 5 O2 -> 3 CO2 + 4 H2O
    Final equation

Sodium + Potassium OR Nitrate = Spectator ions
Ions usually aqueous (If in a solution)


Stoichiometry

    idk bro just use a lot of cancelling units to covert to Moles then proper units, then back to desired
    will do more research so I have better understanding

    1. Get an balanced equation for an problem
    2. Write your given information on the left and the wanted info on the right
    3. Convert to Moles
    4. Convert using an mole ratio of elements (from equation)
    5. Convert to the final unit


UNIT 5 

KINETICS and RATE Laws
PROFESSOR DAVE EXPLAINS VIDEO ON KINETICS IS VERY HELPFUL FOR THIS SO WATCH THAT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYqQCojggyM


To find the order of reaction of a molecule you need to find a trial were only that
reactant changes. Then you can look at the initial rate of reaction (reaction rate
 at that given moment) to compare them.

Initial Rate of Reactions should be in Moles/second


0th Order reactions  [A]^0
No effect


1st order reactions :)  [A]^1

The initial rate of reaction depends on the concentration linearly of one reactant
Ex: Doubling of the reactant A2 results in reaction rate doubling from 1 to 2


2nd order reaction  [A]^2

The initial rate of reaction depends on the concenetration an reactant squared.
Ex:
    You double the amount of reactant D2 this results in 2^2 increase in imitial reaction
    rate. Aka a quadrupling of the initial reaction rate. 
    If you triple the reactant amount, it would result in a 3^2 increase in initial reaction
    rate.


ALSO overall reaction order is the sum of the orders of the reactants


HOW TO WRITE THE RATE Laws

    Rate would be equal to k (rate constant) times the first reactant power of the reaction order 
    times the next reactant to the power of the reaction order and so on.

    Rate = k * [Reactant1 Moles]^order * [Reactamt2 Moles]^order and so on


    With a reactants A and B in moles, first order and second order respectively. It would be
    (btw just take values from any trial)

    Rate = k * [A Moles]^1 * [B Moles]^2



HOW TO FIND k (reaction constant)

    Ignoring the everything else but the moles, using that you get Moles to some power (M^3)
    Now you must convert those units into Moles/Seconds.

    Using our example above:

    Rate = k * [A Moles]^1 * [B Moles]^2
    Focusing on only the moles you get

    Moles^3
    now we need to get to Moles/Second by diving by Moles^2 * Seconds

    Moles^3/Moles^2 * Seconds = Moles/Seconds

    So here you get 1/Moles^2 * Seconds 
    also represented as Moles^-2 * seconds^-1

    Now you can just solve the for the value by dividing Rate/(A * B^2) for this case 
    So k = Rate/(A*B^2) * Moles^-2 * Seconds^-1 
    (except A and B would be actual values)


Identifying Order using Graphs

    0th Order
    k[A]^0 

    Graph:
    X-axis: time
    Y-axis: [A]
    Linear decrease (y=-x)


    1st Order
    k[A]^1

    Graph:
    X-axis: Time 
    Y-axis: ln[A]
    Linear decrease (y=-x)


    2nd Order
    k[A]^2
    
    Graph:
    X-axis: Time 
    Y-axis: 1/[A]
    Linear Increase (y=x)

    By plotting [A], ln[A], 1/[A] you can identify which one gives you a straight line
    and that would be the reaction order 

    The rate constant would be equal to the slope of the straight line graphically


Reaction Mechanisms

    Reaction Intermediates

    Molecules that are produced in a early step and then used in a later step
    EX:
        BF3 + O2 -> BF2 + O2F
        BF2 + O2 -> O2F2 + B

        Here you can see that BF2 is an intermdeiate since it is used up and then
        is consumed later

        You can also add them up to get the overall balanced equation of:


        BF3 + BF2 + 2 O2 -> BF2 + O2F + O2F2 + B
        Then you can see that the intermediate BF2 is on both sides so you can just 
        remove it, getting

        BF3 + 2 O2 -> O2F + O2F2 + B


    Rate Determining Step

        This will be the slowest process/step in the reaction, acting as a bottleneck
        The rate equation is usually determined from this step.
        Usually determined by looking at rate laws.

        A lot of the time it would be the first step
    
    The Rate law for the overall reaction is the rate law of the slowest step
