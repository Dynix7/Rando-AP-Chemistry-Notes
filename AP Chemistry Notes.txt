AP Chemistry Notes

Unit 0.5 Kinda


Moles in chemistry(What are they?)

    Moles can often be hard to understand like it took like 30 minutes for me to grasp
    it fully cuz im dense.

    So I recommend watching the following videos:

    1. Steve Mould-An Actually Good Explanation of Moles: https://youtu.be/Z_TjGRPPR9Q
    2. Organic Chemistry Tutor-Introduction to Moles: https://youtu.be/EowJsC7phzw
    3. Professor Dave Explains-The Mole: Avogadro's Number and Stoichiometry: https://youtu.be/H3VKLRNAQuY

    A mole = 6.022 * 10^23
    6.022 * 10^23 is known as Avogadro's Number

    However, this way of thinking about is unintuitive. So I perfer thinking
    about it as a quantity, similar to a dozen.
    For example with molecules A, B, and C

    A + B -> C
    We can also say

    100 A + 100 B -> 100C
    similarly we can also say

    1 Mole A + 1 Mole B -> 1 Mole C

    However, why don't we just say something like 100 A?
    That's because when doing chemistry in real life, 100 A would be something like 0.00000000001 grams
    and we usually don't do chemistry with such small amounts like that, so we use moles.
    
    Now, what is the mass of 1 mole of a element like Lithium?

    For this we need to look at periodic table, we can see that one lithium atom is 7.0 atomic mass units(amu)
    The mole was "designed" in a way such that 1 mole would would be equal to the atomic weight
    of the that element in grams

    So, 1 mole of Lithium would be 7 grams. With this we can see that 1 mole of Iron would be 55.84 grams since
    the amu of Iron of the periodic table is 55.84


    As a result of this, we can represent amu as grams/mole (grams per mole).
    This is also known as molar mass
    EX:
        So Lithium would be 7.0 grams/mole, or have a molar mass of 7.0
    
    This can also be used to convert grams into moles.
    EX:
        7.0 grams Lithium * (1 mole/7 grams) = 1 mole
        This is basically dividing by 7


    Converting grams to moles is espically useful as in chemical equations it is done using quantities, NOT mass
    something like Carbon + Fluoride = Carbon Fluoride (btw this isn't accurate equation). It is one atom of Carbon
    and one atom of Fluoride. If we were given like 10 grams or something, it doesn't tell us anything about how many atoms we have.


Unit 1:

Mass Percent-What percent of a molecule is each element

    Take the atomic mass of each element (Multiply by amount of atoms)
    then add them together: TOTAL MASS
    Individual Total Atomic Mass (per atom)/ Total Mass

    EX: MgCl2
    24.31 + 70.90(35.45x2) = 95.21 amu
    Mg = 24.31/95.21 = 25.53 %
    Cl = 70.90/95.21 = 74.47 %

Mass Spectrometry-Graph of the masses of the isotopes (if they exist)
    EX: Two bars = 2 isotopes
    Find the average atomic mass based on their Relative abundence
    Atomic Mass * Relative abundence: THEN add them up


Electron Configuriations

Videos that are helpful:
HIGHLY RECCOMENDED Professor Dave Explains-Quantum Numbers, Atomic Orbitals, and Electron Configurations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aoi4j8es4gQ
Organic Chemistry Tutor-Electron Configuration - Basic introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIwcDnFjj98


EVERY configuration HAS 2 ELECRTONS


Defining values (Known as Quantum Numbers)

n: Electron's main energy level/Shell
    Higher number = more energy

ℓ = n-1
    Describes the shape of the electron orbital
    0: S orbital shape
    1: P orbital shape
    2: D orbital shape
    3: F orbital shape

m 
    Describes the number of possible configurations
    m: -ℓ to ℓ (Its L btw not 1)

    EX: D orbital's ℓ number is 2 so possible orbitals are
    -2 -1 0 1 2   TOTAL: 5 Configurations
    
    As a result the D subshell can hold a total of 10 electrons (2 per configuration)

s (This is per each electron)
    Describes the spin of each electron

    s = +1/2 OR -1/2
    Can either be -1/2 or +1/2
    In a each configuration, there are a max of two electrons (stated above), in this
    1 electron will ALWAYS be +1/2
    1 electron will ALWAYS be -1/2



Pauli Exclusion Principle

    No two electrons will be exactly same (aka have the same n, ℓ, m, and s)
    This is because even if 2 electrons are in the same configuration the spin
    will always be different (one +1/2 and one -1/2)


The shells are filled up at each level at the lowest level (S configuration) until they reach
the max for the given shell then move onto the next shell (Aufbau principle)

EX:
    For example an atom with 3 electrons will completely fill up the first shell
    S orbital so it will move onto the 2nd shell S orbital.

    An atom with 5 electrons will fill up the 1st shell and the 2nd S orbital 
    so it move to the P orbital in the 2nd shell


S - Sphere shape 
    1 POSSIBLE Configuriation
    Lowest relative energy (compared within energy level/shell)

P - Dumbell/infinity shape
    3 POSSIBLE Configuriations (one per XYZ axis)

D - Complex shape
    5 Configuriations

F - Complex shape
    7 Configuriations
    Highest relative energy (compared within energy level/shell)


NOTE:
As a result of the 3 P configurations in total it can hold 6 electrons per shell
since there are 2 electrons per configuration with 3 configurations

THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ALL THE OTHER SHAPES


EX:
    Hydrogen will be 1s^1
    1 = first Shell
    s = sphere shape
    ^1 = 1 Electron

    Helium will be 1s^2
    1 = First Shell
    s = Sphere shape
    ^2 = 2 electrons

Beryillyum(3 electrons) will be 1s^2 2s^1
First shell S orbital mpletely full
Second shell S orbital then filled with 1 electron

If there were more it will finish filling the S electron orbital, since its the lowest
energy level then begin filling up the next P orbital.




PERIODIC TABLE TRENDS

Atomic Radius
    Greatest at the LEFT and BOTTOM of the table
    
    Bottom: Greatest # of electron shells
    Left: Least number of Protons 
    So weak attraction


Ionic Radius

    Cations (Positive): Tend to be Smaller
        More less electrons so Smaller

    Anions (Negative): Tend to be bigger
        More electrons so bigger

    More Protons = Greater pull between protons and electrons


First Ionization Energy
    Essentially Energy to remove the last electron from the atom

    Greatest at RIGHT and TOP of the tablbe

    Top: Fewest amount of electron shells so closer to protons
    Right: Have greater "effective nuclear charge;" more protons to attract electrons


Photoelectron Spectrometry:

    X-axis: Relative Binding Energy per electrons (Joules)
    Y-axis: Relative Number of electrons
    
    Read left to right, each peak represents an electron configuration
    Height of the peak = # of electrons
    EX:
        A peak with a height of 2 will be an S shape (cuz 2 electrons in S shape)
        A peak with a height of 6 will be an P shape (since 6 total electrons)

    
    More electrons = Higher peak

    Generally: The more protons, the greater binding energy (so more left)


UNIT 2



Hund's Rule (Might be unit 1 idk)
    I recommend watching the video linked above for better pictures

    For each subshell (s, p, d, f), the electrons will be filled singly with paralell spins up
    
    In the case of an 2p subshell, there will be 6 total spots (2 per configuration)

    __ __ __
    First, it will begin by filling one in each configuration facing up

    ↑_ ↑_ ↑_
    Like this going left to right

    Then they will pair up with new electrons facing down

    ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓
    Like this, also going left to right

    If there were only five electrons it would look like this:
    ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑_

    Unpaired electrons make the atom: PARAMAGNETIC
        This means that CAN interact with magnetic fields

    Fully paired electrons make the atom: DIAMAGNETIC
        This means that it CAN'T interact with magnetic fields


    The electrons start filling separate subshell configurations before paring up since this keeps them the
    furthest apart (negatives repulse) and the lowest energy

    

Ionic Bonds

    Ionic bonds are bonds where an electron is TAKEN from an atom
    This results in a positive and negative ion, and these will be attracted to eachother forming a bond
    (Like a magnet)
    EX:
        NaCl is Na+1Cl-1
        Where Chlorine takes one electron from Sodium, making Sodium positive ion and Chlorine a negative ion


    Lattice Energy

    Essentially the energy/how strong the ionic bond is
    Factors that affect lattice energy are:

    Charge
        Increased Magnitude of charge = INCREASED lattice energy
        Think about it like a stronger magnet = harder to take apart
        EX:
            Na+1Cl-1 vs Mg+2O-2
            MgO would have a higher lattice energy since the the NaCl


    Distance
        Increased distance = LOWER lattice energy
        Magnets further apart means a lesser pull together

        Larger atomic radii of atoms = further apart
        So larger atoms bonded together will have a lower lattice energy compared to smaller
        atoms since they're further apart(assuming equal magnitude of charge)
        EX:
            Li+1F-1 VS Na+1Cl-1
            LiF would have a higher lattice energy since they're smaller and closer together,
            so the pull is stronger

    IMPORTANT: 
    
    Use charge FIRST to determine lattice energy THEN use distance
    Ex:
        If your comparing two molecules and the first one has a greater magnitude of charge
        while the 2nd molecule has a lower distance.
        
        The first molecule will have a greater lattice energy since it has a greater magnitude of charge
        despite being further apart


Relative Melting Points (Ionic)
 
    Ionic compounds that have a HIGHER lattice energy will have a HIGHER melting point
    Think about it like its harder to pull apart so its harder to melt

    So molecules with a higher magnitude of charge (or lower distance if charge is equal)
    will have a higher melting point


Covalent Bonds
    
    Covalent bonds are bonds that form by the sharing of electrons between atoms
    they typically result in the atoms atoms having full valence electron shells


Metallic Bonds

    In metallic bonds, the electrons of free-flowing (Can move around easily)
    Called "Sea of electrons"
    This is due to the electrons being loosely bound to the nucleus

    Results in properties like: Conductivity, Malleability, and strength


Electronegativity

    Essentially, how much an atom wants electrons
    Greatest at the top right (Due to small atomic radius, and proton pull)

    Determines the type of bond that is formed

    Greater than 1.4: Ionic Bonds
    
    Less than 1.4: Covalent bonds

        Greater than 0.5 (but less than 1.4): Polar covalent bond
        Less than 0.5: Non-polar covalent bond
    
    
Polar Covalent Bonds result in a: Dipole

    In a dipole, electrons will spend more time at one side of a molecule,
    making that side paritally negative (δ-) and one side paritally positive (δ+)

    Organic Chemistry Tutor-Hybridization of Atomic Orbitals - Sigma & Pi Bonds - Sp Sp2 Sp3: https://youtu.be/pdJeQUd2g_4

Types of Bonds (for covalent):
    Sigma Bonds (Most stable)
    Pi Bonds

    Sigma bonds- First bond is ALWAYS a Sigma bond

    Pi bonds-ONE of the bonds in a double is a PI, TWO in a Triple Bond

    Essentially:

    Single Bond: 1 Sigma Bond  
        THE LONGEST BOND

    Double Bond: 1 Sigma, 1 Pi
        Shorter Bond

    Triple Bond: 1 Sigma, 2 Pi
        Even Shorter bond



Hybridization:
    Number of Electron domains = Electrons pairs and bonds on valence shell
    
    Hybridization is the combining of electron subshells

    Bonding will start with the LOWEST energy level (s) in the shell/energy level and move up

    1 Electron Domain = s 
        Valence Shell: s configuration is bonded

    2 Electron Domains = sp^1
        Valence Shell: First s configuration is bonded, then the P configuration

    3 Electron Domains = sp^2
        Valence Shell: First the s configuration is bonded, then the two other p configurations   

    4 Electron domains = sp^3
        Valence Shell: First the s configuration is bonded, then the 3 p configurations




Solids

    Molecular Covalent

        Discrete molecules that are formed with covalent bonds
        Generally low strength aka low melting point, easy to break due to weaker partial charges
        EX: H2O
    

    Network Covalent

        Molecules (or atoms) that are all bound together continuosly by covalent bonds
        Generally rigid and inflexible 
        EX: Diamond (Carbon) or Silicon Dioxide (SiO2)


    Ionic Solids

        Forms a lattice of ions
        Ex:
            Cl- Na+ Cl-
            Na+ Cl- Na+
            Cl- Na+ Cl-

        Usually strong due to the full charges
        Dissolves in water due to its charge and conducts electricity (in water)
        Brittle
    

    Metallic Solids

        Defined by "sea of electrons"
        
        Conducts electricity well since electrons can move freely along
        Maleable(Doesn't snap basically)
        Not solubility 
    

Alloy

    Mixture of metal and metal or non-metal that has new properties

    Substitutional Alloy

        Alloy where the other material in slots in/replaces an spot where an metal atom would usually be
        Occurs when the new material's atoms is of an similar size to the original metal

    Intersitial Alloy

        Alloy where the other material is in the slots INBETWEEN the metal atons
        Occurs when the new material's atoms is much smaller

        Often stronger, harder, and and less ductile (ability to be stretched)


Polarity

    NOT ABOUT THE SYMMETRY OF THE MOLECULE
    ABOUT IF THERE's AN UNBALANCED REGION OF ELECTRONS like lone pairs of electrons

    Bent Structure = Polar
    Unbalanced region of electrons = Polar


Intermolecular Forces

    Polar: Dipole-dipole Forces
        Two polar molecules interact due to their partial positive and negative charges
        With the positve and negative ends of each interacting with eachother (like a magnet)

        Kinda also includes Hydrogen Bonding

        Organic CHemistry Tutor-How to Draw Lewis Dot Structures:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFZtjSeT3XE

    Drawing the Strucutre
        1. Draw the chemical symbol(Ex:H, C, N, Pb, etc) for the atom

        2. Draw the atom that can form the most bonds in the CENTER 

        3. Determine the # of valence electrons (electrons in outermost shell)
            # for common elements are:
            Oxygen: 6 valence electrons
            Carbon: 4 valence electrons
            Hydrogen: 1 valence electron
            Nitrogen: 5 valence electrons

        4. Draw dots representing valence electrons one at a time going around (drawn up, down, left, right)
        (Ex for oxygen: Draw a dot on top, right, bottom, left. THEN pair electrons up, drawing one on top and to the right)
        Also, it doesn't matter which one you pair up (it can be the top, bottom, left, or right)

        Ex: Oxygen is   .             ..
                     .. O ..  NOT   .. O ..
                        .


    Drawing Bonds
        
        OK SO THIS ACTUALLY ISN'T FULLY RECOMMENDED CUZ IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK FOR RESONANCE STRUCTURES WHILE THE OTHER WAY DOES WORK FOR EVERYTHING
        SO JUST SCROLL DOWN TO THE RESONANCE DRAWING BONDS Guide

        //1. Determine the # of bonds (Basically # of lone pairs)
        //    Each atom would typically want 8 electrons for an full shell, except hydrogen which wants 2 electrons
        //2. Pair up the lone electrons BETWEEN atoms, each of pairs these will be a bond

        //Ex:
            //Two oxygens will bond together since each one has a lone electron, this will form a total of 2 bonds
            //and each atom will have 2 lone pairs

        However, sometimes there will be more complex bonds so read below

    Resounance Structures

        These are molecules that can't be represented using one lewis dot diagram due to having 2 (or more) configurations. 

        In reality these molecules exist in a blended state in between possible configurations
        (like instead of a double bond and single bond, it would be like a 1.5)

        To represent them them we have multiple lewis dot strucutres with "<->" between them
        OR as a signle molecule with the bond that resonates is drawn as a dashed line 
        Ex:
            Ozone (O3 is an example of this)

            O = O - O  <->  O - O = O

        DRAWING THE BONDS
            btw i do still recommend reading the "Extremely Helpful" article above for more detail

            1. Determine the total number of valence electrons avaliable

            2. Connnect all the atoms with a single bond

            3. Determine the number of valence electrons left by subtracting the number used in bonds (btw 2 electrons per bond)

            4. Begin by checking each atom to find ones that don't have a full shell (8 is full for most elements, except hydrogen which is 2)

            5. Next begin filling atoms with electrons to fill the shell (usually 8 is full, also each bond has 2 already) 
               STARTING WITH THE ATOMS ON THE OUTSIDE 

            6. Place an any extra electrons on the center atom

            7. Determine if the center atom has a full octet, if it doesn't determine the number of bonds it needs

            8. Draw a bond with one of the outer atoms to fufill the octet for the center atom
               Remove one electron pair from the outer atom that is being bonded, these two make up will make up the bond

            9. Determine if there are any other possible configurations (for step 8), if so draw them out too

            Ex:
                Ozone (O3)
                Has 6 valence electrons per atom so a total of 18 valence electrons

                Draw the atoms connected connected with single bonds
                O - O - O

                These 2 bonds will use up 4 electrons, so we have 14 valence electrons left to distribute
                We will first fill up the oxygen's on the left and right to 8
                  ..      ..
                .. O - O - O ..
                  ..      ..

                Now, we will fill up the center oxygen with any extra electrons, in this case 2
                  ..  ..  ..
                .. O - O - O ..
                  ..      ..                

                We can see that the center oxygen still needs 2 more electrons, aka it need one more bond. 
                So we will take an electron pair from one of the oxygens (either left or right) to form this bond

                  ..  ..  ..   
                .. O = O - O ..  
                          ..    

                      OR

                  ..  ..  ..
                .. O - O = O ..
                  ..         


    Formal Charge

    Charge assuming bonds are shared equally (disregarding electronegativity)
    When assessing an strucutre, you want to aim for each atom to have an formal charge closest to 0

    The structures with the LOWEST formal charges (cloest to 0) will contribute the MOST to the structure

    Formula for formal charge:
        Formal Charge = Valence Electrons (Before any bonding) - Bonds - dots (lone elctrons)
    
    Ex:
        H2O                                         
      .. ..     Calculation for Oxygen: 6 valence electrons - 2 bonds - 4 dots = 0
        O       Calculation for first Hydrogen: 1 - 1 - 0 = 0
       / \      Calculation for Hydrogen: 1 - 1 - 0 = 0
      H   H 

    So this would be neutral in terms of formal charge. In reality it isn't because formal charge
    doesn't take the electronegativity of oxygen into account


VSEPER THEORY (Molecular Geometry)
    
    VSEPR = Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion

    This essentially states that in a molecule the bonded atoms (technically electrons) repel eachother, and the
    lone pairs of electrons are even more repulsive than those. 

    In models,
    The fully black cone shaped bond means the atom pointed TOWARDS you
    The dashed cone bond means that the atom is pointed AWAY from you


    So now it basically just memorizing all of the combinations and the shapes created so im just gonna copy and paste it here

    Heres a Chart (Scroll Down): https://chemistrytalk.org/vsepr-theory/
    There's also a chart and more info on the Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSEPR_theory

    ok so thats all im gonna put since u probably don't need to know past like the 4 bonds


rando side note if u didn't know:
    In water, the H(parital +) and O(partial -) will pull apart ions



UNIT 3

Gas Laws
PV = nRT
Presssure * Volume = # of Moles * Universal Gas Constant * Temperature

Converting Grams and Molar Mass
Molar Mass is grams/mole (grams per mole)


Spectrophotometry (Concentration of Molecules and the absorbanence at each concentration)

    Run a Blank (aka 0 concentration and 0 absorbanence)
    Then have several known concentrations and their coressponding absorbanences
    Next, draw the line of best fit 
    Now you can determine absorbance of unknown concentrations :D 



Net Ionic Equations

IMPORTANT: Metal ions react WITH metal ions; non-metals react WITH non-metal ions

There can be spectator ions these are NOT A PART OF THE EQUATION

You need to balancce the amounts of each atom of the products and the reactants

EX:
    Mg, Cu2+ and Cl-
    Cl- is an spectator ion since its an non metal

    Mg -> Mg2+ + 2e-  Oxidation- Losing Electrons
    2e- + Cu2+ -> Cu  Reduction- Gaining Electrons
    
    Mg(s) + Cu2+(aq) -> Mg2+(aq) + Cu(s)


Burning: Includes adding OXYGEN to an equation

EX:
    Na + O2 -> Na2O
    To balance oxygen we will mutiply right side by 2

    Na + O2 -> 2 Na2O
    To balance sodium will we multiply sodium by 4

    4 Na + O2 -> 2 Na2O
    Final equation

EX:
    C3H8 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O
    To balance C multiply by 3. To balance H multiply by 4

    C3H8 + O2 -> 3 CO2 + 4 H2O
    To balance oxygen multiply O2 by 5

    C3H8 + 5 O2 -> 3 CO2 + 4 H2O
    Final equation

Sodium + Potassium OR Nitrate = Spectator ions
Ions usually aqueous (If in a solution)


Stoichiometry

    idk bro just use a lot of cancelling units to covert to Moles then proper units, then back to desired
    will do more research so I have better understanding

    1. Get an balanced equation for an problem
    2. Write your given information on the left and the wanted info on the right
    3. Convert to Moles
    4. Convert using an mole ratio of elements (from equation)
    5. Convert to the final unit

KINETICS and RATE Laws
PROFESSOR DAVE EXPLAINS VIDEO ON KINETICS IS VERY HELPFUL FOR THIS SO WATCH THAT
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYqQCojggyM


To find the order of reaction of a molecule you need to find a trial were only that
reactant changes. Then you can look at the initial rate of reaction (reaction rate
 at that given moment) to compare them.

Initial Rate of Reactions should be in Moles/second


0th Order reactions  [A]^0
No effect


1st order reactions :)  [A]^1

The initial rate of reaction depends on the concentration linearly of one reactant
Ex: Doubling of the reactant A2 results in reaction rate doubling from 1 to 2


2nd order reaction  [A]^2

The initial rate of reaction depends on the concenetration an reactant squared.
Ex:
    You double the amount of reactant D2 this results in 2^2 increase in imitial reaction
    rate. Aka a quadrupling of the initial reaction rate. 
    If you triple the reactant amount, it would result in a 3^2 increase in initial reaction
    rate.


ALSO overall reaction order is the sum of the orders of the reactants


HOW TO WRITE THE RATE Laws

    Rate would be equal to k (rate constant) times the first reactant power of the reaction order 
    times the next reactant to the power of the reaction order and so on.

    Rate = k * [Reactant1 Moles]^order * [Reactamt2 Moles]^order and so on


    With a reactants A and B in moles, first order and second order respectively. It would be
    (btw just take values from any trial)

    Rate = k * [A Moles]^1 * [B Moles]^2



HOW TO FIND k (reaction constant)

    Ignoring the everything else but the moles, using that you get Moles to some power (M^3)
    Now you must convert those units into Moles/Seconds.

    Using our example above:

    Rate = k * [A Moles]^1 * [B Moles]^2
    Focusing on only the moles you get

    Moles^3
    now we need to get to Moles/Second by diving by Moles^2 * Seconds

    Moles^3/Moles^2 * Seconds = Moles/Seconds

    So here you get 1/Moles^2 * Seconds 
    also represented as Moles^-2 * seconds^-1

    Now you can just solve the for the value by dividing Rate/(A * B^2) for this case 
    So k = Rate/(A*B^2) * Moles^-2 * Seconds^-1 
    (except A and B would be actual values)


Identifying Order using Graphs

    0th Order
    k[A]^0 

    Graph:
    X-axis: Time
    Y-axis: [A]
    Linear decrease (y=-x)


    1st Order
    k[A]^1

    Graph:
    X-axis: Time 
    Y-axis: ln[A]
    Linear decrease (y=-x)


    2nd Order
    k[A]^2
    
    Graph:
    X-axis: Time 
    Y-axis: 1/[A]
    Linear Increase (y=x)

    By plotting [A], ln[A], 1/[A] you can identify which one gives you a straight line
    and that would be the reaction order 

    The rate constant would be equal to the slope of the straight line graphically


Reaction Mechanisms

    Reaction Intermediates

    Molecules that are produced in a early step and then used in a later step
    EX:
        BF3 + O2 -> BF2 + O2F
        BF2 + O2 -> O2F2 + B

        Here you can see that BF2 is an intermdeiate since it is used up and then
        is consumed later

        You can also add them up to get the overall balanced equation of:


        BF3 + BF2 + 2 O2 -> BF2 + O2F + O2F2 + B
        Then you can see that the intermediate BF2 is on both sides so you can just 
        remove it, getting

        BF3 + 2 O2 -> O2F + O2F2 + B


    Rate Determining Step

        This will be the slowest process/step in the reaction, acting as a bottleneck
        The rate equation is usually determined from this step.
        Usually determined by looking at rate laws.

        A lot of the time it would be the first step
    
    The Rate law for the overall reaction is the rate law of the slowest step
